##File structure differs from standard due to usage of LibGDX library  

## core and desktop folder hold all relevant source code for the game  

## Assets folder under core directory is to be used to store the resources for your project only. This includes images, sounds, map text files, etc.

## .gradle files are included to handle command line creation of JAR and dependency management    

## jar folder is used to store the built jar of your term-project. NO SOURCE CODE SHOULD BE IN THIS FOLDER. DOING SO WILL CAUSE POINTS TO BE DEDUCTED
